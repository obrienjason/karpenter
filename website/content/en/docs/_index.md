Karpenter is an open-source autoscaling project built for Kubernetes. It improves availability for Kubernetes applications without requiring manually or over-provisioning compute resources. Karpenter is designed to provide the right compute resources to match your applicationâ€™s needs in seconds, instead of minutes by observing the aggregate resource requests of unschedulable pods and makes decisions to launch and terminate nodes to minimize scheduling latencies.
